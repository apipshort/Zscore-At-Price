- Text object "text" renamed to "obj".
- "obj" creation and updating done in single code block (lns 87-90)
- Only changed properties update when the initial if(!ObjectSet test returns "true".
- Any manipulation of the text box by user will be negated on next tick, as correct properties are restored.
- Deleted, the box will be recreated. Moved, it will snap back to position, etc.
